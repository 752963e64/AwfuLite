  for Windows and Linux

## TODO
- linux clipboards
- rounded rectangle
- code folding
- more plugins
- remove the ugly tabs and keep track/handling with mouse/key press events into statusview
- scroll feedback using sort* icons into the statusview

## HINT'ING
- <s>linux clipboards needs to be added with either X lib or XCB to the api</s>

Done through **[a customized SDL2](https://github.com/HackIT/mySDL2)**

lua part in WIP state... still need to resolv some coords and write the perfect formula...

- rounded rectangle in my guess still need some modification into the api...

like implementing the primitives to draw rounded corners a like the squared one is done...
- code folding should be easy as there is already block search functions, I just need more info about document's buffers...
- tabs should be easy to remove and implement a new way to browse file...
- scroll feedback should be extremly easy... just need to find an handy place to make it cool...
