## TODO
- <s>linux clipboards</s>
- rounded rectangle
- code folding
- more plugins
- remove the ugly tabs
- keep track/handling with mouse/key press events and feedback into statusview
- scroll feedback using sort* icons into the statusview

## HINT'ING

- rounded rectangle in my guess still need some modification into the api...

like implementing the primitives to draw rounded corners...

- code folding should be easy as there is already block search functions, I just need more info about document's buffers...
- tabs should be easy to remove and implement a new way to browse file...
- scroll feedback should be extremly easy... just need to find an handy place to make it cool...
